```javascript
// Redux Store Structure
{
  feedback: {
    step: 0,                    // Current form step (0-3)
    full_name: '',              // Customer name
    email: '',                  // Customer email
    phone: '',                  // Customer phone
    purchase_date: '',          // Purchase date (auto-filled)
    products: [],               // Array of selected products
    feedback: '',               // Customer feedback text
    rating_quality: 0,          // Quality rating (1-5)
    rating_staff: 0,            // Staff rating (1-5)
    rating_experience: 0,       // Experience rating (1-5)
    signature: '',              // Base64 signature image
    submitted: false            // Form submission status
  }
}
```

  rating_staff: number,
  rating_experience: number,
  signature: string (base64)
}
